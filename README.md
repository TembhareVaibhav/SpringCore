Inversion of Control :
                      IOC is a inversion of control which can create object and manage. 
                      Spring Bean is a part of IOC, objects are created by IOC, those objects are known as beans.
                      

IOC is a container where we store all the objects of our configuration files as "Beans". Bean is nothing but a object of our class that we store inside the IOC container.
